You are required to create a detailed .md file that systematically requests all necessary project details from the developer or system to help diagnose and resolve the issue where:

The User Dashboard UI is not updating or reflecting completed features.

The login page remains in its basic state despite backend completion.

ðŸ“‚ The .md file should request the following:
Project Overview:

Full project description.

Tech stack used (frontend, backend, database, libraries, frameworks).

Frontend Details:

List of all frontend files.

Confirmation of whether Tailwind CSS is fully configured.

Component tree structure (which components are built and active).

Confirmation if WebSocket and API connections are integrated into the frontend.

Status of real-time UI components (queue display, forwarding builder, API key management).

Backend Details:

List of all API endpoints created.

Full WebSocket integration status.

Backend health (confirm if the Telegram OTP endpoint is working and accessible).

Any pending backend API deployments.

API Connection:

Confirm if the frontend is correctly connected to the backend endpoints.

UI Development:

List of completed UI components.

Confirmation of drag-and-drop forwarding builder availability.

Request frontend console error logs.

Check if there are any API call failures visible in the browser network tab.

Visual Verification:

Ask for current screenshots of the User Dashboard (dashboard, forwarding builder, API key page, health monitoring page).

ðŸ“Œ Completion Requirement:
The .md file must clearly list all the above requested details, structured section-wise, so that a reviewer or AI agent can fully diagnose:
