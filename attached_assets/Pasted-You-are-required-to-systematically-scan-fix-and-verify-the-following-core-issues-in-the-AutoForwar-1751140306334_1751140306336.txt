You are required to systematically scan, fix, and verify the following core issues in the AutoForwardX project to make the system fully functional and correctly connected.

ðŸ“‚ ðŸ”§ Key Issues to Address:
1. âœ… Redis Connection Failure
Investigate and fix the Redis connection issue:

text
Copy
Edit
Error 99 connecting to localhost:6379
Ensure the Redis server is installed, running, and listening on the correct port.

Verify Redis connection strings and environment variables in both backend and Celery configurations.

Restart Redis and Celery services and confirm queue processing works.

2. âœ… CORS Misconfiguration
Properly configure allowedDevOrigins in next.config.js:

js
Copy
Edit
const nextConfig = {
  allowedDevOrigins: [
    'https://your-replit-url', // replace with your active development URL
    'http://localhost:5000'
  ],
};

module.exports = nextConfig;
Validate FastAPI CORS middleware:

python
Copy
Edit
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware

app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],  # Use specific URLs in production
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)
Ensure no cross-origin request blocking for /api/* and /_next/* resources.

3. âœ… API and WebSocket Connection Validation
Confirm frontend is using the correct API base URL and WebSocket URL:

Example: http://localhost:8000/api and ws://localhost:8000/ws

Validate that:

Authentication tokens are stored and attached to all API requests.

WebSocket subscriptions are established after login.

WebSocket events are properly handled and UI updates are triggered.

4. âœ… Redis Queue and WebSocket Backend Validation
Ensure queue processing (Celery) is working correctly with Redis.

Verify that backend WebSocket is:

Broadcasting live forwarding pair status updates.

Sending queue and session health events.

Confirm WebSocket connections are not silently failing or timing out.

5. âœ… Frontend API Integration and UI Rendering
Ensure the frontend is:

Properly calling all backend API endpoints.

Subscribing to WebSocket events and updating UI in real-time.

Fully develop the UI components:

Real-time dashboard

Forwarding pair management

Drag-and-drop builder

API key management

Webhook management

Session and queue monitoring

Add loading indicators, toast notifications, and error handling for all user interactions.

6. âœ… Mobile Responsiveness and Styling
Properly style the login page and all dashboard components using Tailwind CSS.

Ensure all components are mobile-friendly and responsive.

Fix the bg-dark-card/80 utility class error:

Either correct the Tailwind config to support opacity or use:

html
Copy
Edit
bg-dark-card bg-opacity-80
7. âœ… System Health Testing
Test:

Login and OTP functionality end-to-end.

API connectivity from the frontend.

WebSocket live updates.

Queue processing via Redis.

Real-time UI updates for forwarding status.

âœ… Final Deliverables:
Fully working Redis connection.

CORS issues resolved with no blocked requests.

WebSocket fully integrated and showing live updates.

API requests working correctly from frontend to backend.

Login page and dashboard fully styled and responsive.

Real-time UI components (status, queue, session, analytics) fully visible and functional.
