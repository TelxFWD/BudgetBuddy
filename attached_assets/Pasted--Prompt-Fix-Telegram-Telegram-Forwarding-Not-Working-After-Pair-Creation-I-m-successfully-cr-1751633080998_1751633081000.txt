üéØ Prompt: Fix Telegram ‚Üí Telegram Forwarding Not Working After Pair Creation

I'm successfully creating a forwarding pair via:

POST /api/forwarding/pairs

cpp
Copy
Edit

Confirmed pair data:
```json
{
  "name": "forex",
  "source_platform": "telegram",
  "target_platform": "telegram",
  "source_id": "-1002833847948",
  "target_id": "-1002840509370",
  "delay_mode": "realtime",
  "delay_minutes": 0,
  "delay_seconds": 0,
  "copy_mode": false,
  "filter_keywords": [],
  "add_header": false,
  "add_footer": false,
  "strip_mentions": false
}
üö® But the actual message forwarding is NOT happening.
Please do the following:

‚úÖ 1. Check Telegram Session
Make sure the Telegram account is logged in using valid session

Ensure the source account is:

‚úÖ An admin in the source channel (source_id)

‚úÖ Can read messages

Ensure the target account:

‚úÖ Is admin with post permission in the target channel (target_id)

If session is not loaded, check Redis or the Telegram client manager initialization log.

‚úÖ 2. Celery Queue & Worker Check
Ensure Celery is running and connected to Redis

Inspect if tasks are queued or stuck in pending/processing

Verify worker is consuming from the correct queue like:

nginx
Copy
Edit
celery -A app.celery_app worker --loglevel=info
Add a log in handle_forwarding_task() or process_telegram_to_telegram() to confirm if it‚Äôs being triggered

‚úÖ 3. Add Debug Logs (Backend)
In your forwarding task:

python
Copy
Edit
logger.info(f"‚è© Starting forwarding for pair {pair_id}")
logger.info(f"‚úÖ Forwarded message {message_id} to {target_id}")
logger.warning(f"‚ö†Ô∏è Skipped forwarding due to missing session or permissions")
Check if it logs anything when a message is sent in the source channel.

‚úÖ 4. Check Webhooks / Polling
Confirm if you are using Telethon polling or webhook mode

For polling, ensure:

Telegram client is authenticated

client.run_until_disconnected() is active

For webhook, check FastAPI route /webhook exists and is triggered by Telegram

‚úÖ 5. Fix if Missing:
If source_id/target_id is being stored but not monitored, run:

python
Copy
Edit
telegram_client.add_event_handler(forward_handler, events.NewMessage(chats=[source_id]))
‚úÖ 6. Manual Test:
Send a message in the source group/channel and check logs for any activity:

No log = session not loaded or handler not attached

Error log = likely a permission issue or Telegram rate-limiting

Once issue is found and fixed, confirm by replying:

‚úÖ Forwarding now works between source and target Telegram channels
