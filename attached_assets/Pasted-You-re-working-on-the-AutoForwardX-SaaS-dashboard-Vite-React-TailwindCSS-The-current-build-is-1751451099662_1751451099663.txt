You’re working on the AutoForwardX SaaS dashboard (Vite + React + TailwindCSS). The current build is partially complete but has serious UI and backend connectivity issues.

✅ Your job is to FIX and COMPLETE the User Dashboard according to the specs below:

---

### 🔧 UI / UX Fixes:

1. **Remove System Status Block**
   - Delete or comment out the `<SystemStatus />` card from `/dashboard`
   - Replace with Plan Summary and Quick Actions (if needed)

2. **Fix Broken Buttons**
   - `Add Pair`, `Delete`, `Pause`, `Edit`, `Reconnect`, `Switch`, `Remove` → must call backend
   - Use `axios` with endpoints like:
     - `POST /forwarding/pairs`
     - `DELETE /forwarding/pairs/:id`
     - `PATCH /forwarding/pairs/:id`
   - Show error/success toast notifications

3. **Analytics Page**
   - Currently shows “Coming Soon” → Complete it with:
     - Total Messages
     - Weekly Activity (bar chart)
     - Success Rate (pie chart)
     - Export as CSV/PDF (only for Pro/Elite)
   - Use `Recharts` and dummy data until backend wired

4. **Billing Page**
   - Move Billing under a dedicated **Sidebar Tab** (NOT inside Settings)
   - Title: `Billing`
   - Section for:
     - Current Plan
     - Upgrade Plan (button)
     - Payment Method (if any)

---

### 🧩 Feature Components to Build:

1. ✅ **Copy Mode Toggle**
   - Show toggle in each `PairCard` (Elite only)
   - Call `PATCH /forwarding/pairs/:id` to enable copy mode

2. ✅ **Custom Delay Slider**
   - In `AddPairModal`, add slider to set delay (0m–24h)
   - Store in backend `delay_minutes` field

3. ✅ **Block Image/Text**
   - Add toggles to each `PairCard`:
     - [ ] Block Image
     - [ ] Block Text
   - Applies content filters (Elite only)

4. ✅ **Replace Text Rules**
   - Add button in each pair: “Edit Text Filters”
   - Modal with:
     - Search Text
     - Replace With
     - Save

5. ✅ **Multi-Redirect Setup**
   - In `AddPairModal`, allow user to select **multiple destination channels**
   - Store as array in `destinations: []`

### ⚙️ Backend Connectivity

- All UI components must sync with backend:
  - On Load → `GET /auth/me`, `GET /forwarding/pairs`
  - On Create → `POST /forwarding/pairs`
  - On Edit → `PATCH /forwarding/pairs/:id`
  - On Delete → `DELETE /forwarding/pairs/:id`
  - On Reconnect → `POST /telegram/session/reconnect`
- Display backend errors via toast/snackbar

### 🚫 Plan-Based Access Control (Broken)

Fix the feature restriction logic using plan from `auth.me`:

| Feature              | Free | Pro | Elite |
|----------------------|------|-----|--------|
| Max Pairs            | 1    | 15  | Unlimited |
| Copy Mode            | ❌   | ❌  | ✅      |
| Block Text/Image     | ❌   | ❌  | ✅      |
| CSV Export           | ❌   | ✅  | ✅      |
| PDF Export           | ❌   | ❌  | ✅      |
| Discord → Telegram   | ❌   | ✅  | ✅ (50) |

Each restricted button must:
- Show disabled state
- Tooltip: “Upgrade to unlock this feature”
- Trigger upgrade modal if clicked

---

### ✅ Final Checklist:

- Fix blank space/padding
- Remove unused “SystemStatus” code
- All buttons call backend endpoints
- All pages and tabs work
- Billing moved to sidebar
- New features (copy, filter, multi-redirect) implemented
- UI reflects plan restrictions correctly
- No console errors

Use clean, responsive Tailwind UI. Use cards, modals, buttons with violet-indigo theme. Preserve dark mode layout. DO NOT regenerate layout — just apply fixes and enhancements.
