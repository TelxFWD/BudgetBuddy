You are required to:

âœ… Fix Tailwind CSS, CORS, API integration, WebSocket binding, and UI rendering to fully connect the frontend and backend.

ðŸ”§ Detailed Actions Required:
1. Tailwind CSS Configuration
Fix the bg-dark-card utility class:

Option 1: Define dark-card as an RGB color in tailwind.config.js to support /80 opacity.

Option 2: Use bg-opacity-80 with a custom CSS class.

Recompile the project and confirm that the CSS error is fully resolved.

2. CORS Configuration
Add allowedDevOrigins in next.config.js:

js
Copy
Edit
const nextConfig = {
  allowedDevOrigins: ['https://your-replit-url', 'http://localhost:5000']
};

module.exports = nextConfig;
Confirm FastAPI CORS middleware allows frontend domain:

python
Copy
Edit
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware

app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],  # Specify dev URLs in production
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)
3. API Integration Repair
Ensure the frontend API service files point to the correct backend URL.

Validate that all API endpoints (authentication, session, forwarding pairs, analytics) are connected and returning live data.

Connect Redux or other state management to API responses to correctly populate UI components.

4. WebSocket & Real-Time UI Binding
Verify that the useWebSocket hook is correctly configured and actively subscribed to WebSocket events.

Ensure that:

Real-time forwarding statuses are updated in the dashboard.

Queue load, session health, and analytics are rendered live.

Add visual indicators (loading spinners, live status badges, success/error toasts) to confirm real-time updates.

5. Complete UI Development
Fully build and style:

Login page (responsive, modern, properly aligned)

Dashboard home with forwarding management

API key management UI

Real-time analytics with charts

Queue and system health dashboards

Implement loading states, toast notifications, and user feedback for all user interactions.

6. Mobile Responsiveness
Ensure the entire dashboard is mobile-optimized:

Collapsible sidebars

Responsive forms and buttons

Touch-friendly drag-and-drop forwarding builder
