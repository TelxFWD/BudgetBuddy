# User Dashboard Development Part 4: Real-Time Sync, Advanced Controls, API Management, Mobile Optimization

This section focuses on completing the missing components of the User Dashboard. It covers real-time WebSocket integration, webhook/API key UI, advanced forwarding controls, detailed analytics, bulk pair operations, custom delay per pair, queue/session health monitoring, and mobile responsiveness.

## ðŸ“‚ Step 14: WebSocket Integration for Real-Time Sync

### WebSocket Setup

* Implement WebSocket connections using Socket.IO or FastAPI WebSocket.
* Enable real-time status updates for:

  * Forwarding pair status changes (start, pause, resume)
  * Telegram and Discord session health (connected, disconnected)
  * Queue load and processing rate

### UI Integration

* Push real-time notifications to the dashboard without requiring page refresh.
* Show live queue status with inline loading or progress indicators.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Step 15: Webhook & API Key User Interface

### API Key Management UI

* Allow users to generate, view, and revoke API keys.
* Display API key usage limits and current consumption per plan.

### Webhook Configuration UI

* Provide form to add, test, and update webhook URLs.
* Show success/failure test results for webhook validation.
* Display webhook trigger logs and error states.

## ðŸ“‚ Step 16: Advanced Forwarding Controls

### Visual Drag-and-Drop Pair Builder

* Allow users to visually create forwarding chains using drag-and-drop interactions.
* Example: Drag Source âžœ Drop on Destination âžœ Set delay âžœ Configure copy mode.

### Bulk Pair Management

* Add options to:

  * Pause all pairs
  * Resume all pairs
  * Delete all pairs
* Allow users to apply bulk changes to selected pairs via checkbox selection.

### Custom Delay Per Pair

* Provide advanced delay configuration UI to override default/global delays.
* Allow per-pair and per-account delay customization with validation.

## ðŸ“‚ Step 17: Detailed Analytics & Reporting

### Analytics Dashboard

* Show message forwarding volume by:

  * Date range
  * Telegram account
  * Discord account
  * Individual forwarding pairs

### Real-Time Analytics Updates

* WebSocket-based live charts for real-time message flow and queue processing.

### Reporting Features

* Export forwarding statistics as CSV or PDF.
* Add report filtering options by user, account, platform, pair, or time period.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Step 18: Queue & Session Health Monitoring

### System Health Dashboard

* Show queue backlog, retry count, and session connection status.
* Visual indicators (green/yellow/red) for system health.
* Live session reconnection alerts.

### Admin Control UI (Optional)

* Allow admin to restart sessions and clear queues directly from the dashboard.
* Show critical system logs and error tracking.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Step 19: Mobile Optimization

### Mobile Responsive Design

* Ensure all dashboard pages, pair builders, and analytics charts are fully responsive.
* Implement mobile-friendly navigation menus and collapsible sidebars.
* Use loading skeletons and optimized card layouts for smaller screens.
