‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Issues to Fix:

1. **Top Blank Space Bug**
   - Remove excessive margin/padding at the top of all main pages
   - Ensure content starts below the top bar

2. **Non-Functional Buttons**
   - Fix all buttons: Add Pair, Pause, Edit, Delete, Reconnect, Switch, Remove
   - Buttons must be connected to correct backend routes from `apiService` (axios)

3. **System Status Panel**
   - REMOVE the `SystemStatus` component from Dashboard if FastAPI/WebSocket is not implemented
   - Replace with Plan Summary and Forwarding Stats only

4. **Missing Pages**
   - üö´ `Account Manager Page` not created ‚Üí Generate `/accounts` route
     - Shows Telegram/Discord sessions with [Reconnect], [Switch], [Remove]
     - Support max sessions based on user plan
   - üö´ `Settings Page` not created ‚Üí Generate `/settings`
     - Contains: dark mode toggle, logout, delete account, plan upgrade

5. **Backend Integration**
   - Ensure dashboard loads user session from JWT via `GET /auth/me`
   - Connect all functional buttons to:
     - `/forwarding/pairs`
     - `/forwarding/pairs/:id`
     - `/telegram/session`
     - `/discord/session`
     - `/analytics/dashboard`

6. **Plan Feature Gating**
   - Logic exists but is not enforcing correctly
     - Fix visibility of buttons like:
       - Add Pair (disabled when limit reached)
       - Copy Mode toggle (Elite only)
       - Discord ‚Üí Telegram pairs (Pro+ only)
       - PDF Export (Elite only)
     - Use the user plan context (`AuthContext`) to show/hide or lock actions

7. **Visual/UX Fixes**
   - Ensure cards are evenly spaced
   - Add hover effects to all buttons
   - Align charts and tables correctly
   - Display error modals when backend fails (e.g. API returns error)

8. **Refactor & Finalize Pages**
   - `/dashboard`: Show stats, pair summary, active sessions
   - `/forwarding`: Full pair list with working actions
   - `/accounts`: Full list of Telegram/Discord sessions
   - `/analytics`: Charts + export
   - `/settings`: toggle dark mode, delete account, logout

üéØ Objective:
Fully connect the dashboard to backend, fix layout/UI bugs, enable all plan-based restrictions, and ensure responsiveness. All pages must be functional with buttons performing real actions via Axios.
