# Backend Development Part 2: Core API & Real-Time Forwarding (Backend Only)

This part focuses on building API endpoints for the website dashboard and Telegram bot, implementing real-time forwarding between Telegram and Discord, managing queues, enabling webhook support, and building a resilient self-healing system. This is strictly backend-focused. No frontend or UI development should be done at this stage.

## ðŸ“‚ Website API Development (FastAPI)

### Authentication APIs

* JWT-based user login and registration endpoints.
* Endpoint to manage Telegram and Discord account linking.
* Secure token refresh endpoint.

### Forwarding Pair APIs

* CRUD APIs for managing forwarding pairs (add, edit, pause, resume, delete).
* APIs for multi-account Telegram management.
* APIs for Discord server and channel management.

### Analytics APIs

* Endpoint to fetch real-time forwarding statistics (volume, success, errors).
* Endpoint to view active sessions and queue status.

### Payment APIs

* Endpoints to handle PayPal and NowPayments confirmation.
* Webhooks to auto-upgrade or downgrade plans based on payment status.

## ðŸ“‚ Telegram Bot API Development

### Bot Authentication

* Telegram bot token-based user linking.
* Validate bot commands based on authenticated user session.

### Bot Features

* View active forwarding pairs.
* Add new forwarding pairs via inline keyboard.
* Edit, pause, resume, and delete pairs directly from bot menus.
* Switch between multiple Telegram accounts via bot commands.
* Display real-time plan details and remaining pair limits.

### Dynamic Inline Menus

* Multi-step selection: Source channel âžœ Destination channel âžœ Delay setup âžœ Confirmation.
* Per-pair action buttons: Pause, Resume, Edit, Delete.
* Bot notifications for payment status, errors, and session alerts.

## ðŸ“‚ Webhook & API Key Management

### Webhook Broadcasting

* Build system to broadcast forwarding events to user-defined webhooks.

### API Key Management

* API to generate and revoke API keys for third-party integrations.
* Enforce rate-limiting and plan-based restrictions on API key usage.
* Secure API key storage and validation middleware.

## ðŸ“‚ Real-Time Forwarding Logic

### Forwarding Handlers

* Telegram âžœ Telegram
* Telegram âžœ Discord
* Discord âžœ Telegram

### Core Forwarding Functions

* Forward message content, media, and attachments.
* Preserve reply chains between platforms.
* Handle message edits and deletions.
* Support silent mode and per-pair delays.
* Implement copy mode to hide source.

### Rate Limiting and Anti-Ban System

* Implement smart rate limiting based on user plan.
* Auto-throttle queue processing when approaching Telegram API limits.

## ðŸ“‚ Error Handling & Self-Healing

### Error Capture

* Capture all queue errors, session drops, and webhook failures.

### Self-Healing Logic

* Auto-reconnect Telegram and Discord sessions.
* Automatically retry failed forwarding tasks.
* Escalate unresolved errors to admin dashboard for manual review.

### Admin Recovery API

* Admin endpoint to force-restart sessions.
* Admin endpoint to clear or re-queue failed tasks.

This part should be completed with a strict backend-only approach. UI components will be developed in later phases.
